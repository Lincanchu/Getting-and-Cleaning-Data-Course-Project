# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
This repository is a submission from Canchu Lin for the course project of Getting and Cleaning Data. It presents the detailed instructions on how to run an analysis on the Human Activity Recognition dataset.

Dataset

	* "Second_Dataset.txt"

Files

	1. CodeBook.md: a code book that describes the variables and their corresponding data, and the steps that I have 
	taken to clean up the data

	2. run_analysis.R: This is a file that contains the R code for how to download and extract the dataset, and then 
	for how to complete the 5 steps described in the course projectâ€™s requirement
		o Merge the training and the test datasets to create one dataset.
		o Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
		o Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the dataset
		o Appropriately labels the dataset with descriptive variable names.
		o From the dataset in step 4, create a second, independent tidy dataset with the average of each variable
		for each activity and each subject.

	3. Second_Dataset.txt is the exported final dataset after completing all the steps described above.
